Wazimap
=======

Wazimap is a Django application for exploring census and other similar data. It makes it easy to understand a place
through the eyes of the data, and to explore data across a range of places. It is most suited for census data
but can easily be used with other data that is similarly focused on places in a country.

Check out `Wazimap South Africa <http://wazimap.co.za>`_ and `Wazimap Kenya <http://kenya.wazimap.org>`_ to
get an idea of what Wazimap is about.

Wazimap is a fork of the excellent `Censusreporter <https://censusreporter.org>`_ project which was funded by a
`Knight News Challenge grant <http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/10/knight-funding-expands-ires-journalist-friendly-census-site/>`_.
You can also find `Censusreporter on GitHub <https://github.com/censusreporter/censusreporter>`_.

Wazimap builds on Censusreporter and makes it easier to re-use. Wazimap was originally built by
`OpenUp <https://openup.org.za>`_ with the support of `Media Monitoring Africa <http://www.mediamonitoringafrica.org/>`_.
It is maintained by OpenUp.
